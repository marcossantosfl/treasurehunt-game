# treasurehunt-game

This game was created as a parf of an assignment in my first semester in Java.

# How does it work?

Basically you have to run the project on netbeans, once you done it, you select the max of players, age and name of them. To win, you must pick up the correct square that is chosen randomly by the application.

A map will appear on the console showing to pick up a square position, A0 to J9 (100 squares).

- All validations are included, age, name, simbols...
